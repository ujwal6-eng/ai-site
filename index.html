<html><body><h1>Daily AI Fact</h1><p>Here's a short and interesting AI fact:

**DeepMind's AlphaGo AI can play Starcraft II (a complex real-time strategy game) at a professional level - but only when it's told to "be creative" and is not penalized for losing games. This is because Starcraft II requires a deep understanding of complex strategies and game dynamics, which can't be achieved through traditional training methods alone. Giving the AI the freedom to explore and make creative decisions has allowed it to surpass human players in this difficult game.**</p></body></html>
