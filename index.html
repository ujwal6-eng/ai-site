<html><body><h1>Daily AI Fact</h1><p>Here's a fun one:

**The world's first computer bug was an actual insect!** In 1947, a team of engineers was working on the Harvard Mark II computer when they discovered a moth stuck in one of the relays. They taped the moth to the computer log and wrote "_FIRST actual case of bug being found" next to it. From then on, any technical glitch was referred to as a "bug," and the term has been used ever since in the tech industry.
